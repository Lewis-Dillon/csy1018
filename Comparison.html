        <h3> Quick Comparison </h3>
        <p>Above, you can see that I have displayed 3 different job openings, all of which are related to coding and web development in one way or another. The first job (based in Peterborough) is aimed at more experienced web developers and requires a user to be familiar with many different coding languages. 
          However, when comparing this to job number 2 (based in Milton Keynes) you may notice that they also require a similar number of coding languages to be experienced in.  Although this is the case, job two does not require the applicant to be fully versed in the languages but to be familiar with them. This is due to the job including a slight part of training of which will help the junior web developer to get more accustomed to said languages. 
          Training can also be seen in job 3 (based in Oxfordshire) of which is also aimed towards quite new programmers (this time to graduates). This job doesn’t require much experience for a chance to obtain the job (however, ideal candidates are listed to have experience with 3 specific coding languages).
          As you can see by wages, the more experience you have with coding languages, the more likely you will be able to obtain jobs with higher income. However, an anomaly has occurred regarding job 2 and 3 where job 3 (needing less experience) is offering more pay then that of job 2. 
          Now, one similarity that is shared amongst all the jobs researched is that applicants are expected to have good teamworking and interpersonal skills. Even more shocking is that job 2 and 3 place interpersonal skills above coding experience. This shows that employees tend to look for people with potential to learn and make more money in the long run and even if you are the worlds best coder, if you can’t cooperate in the workplace, you will find it hard to obtain a job.
