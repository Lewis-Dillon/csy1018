      <h3>Research on good practice</h3>
        <p>One design aspect that we have noticed when browsing webpages for ideas is that of how most websites tend to keep a header, navbar and logo of the site on the top of the webpage in a horizontal fashion. This seems to be quite popular amongst trending websites due to its user-friendly nature and ensures that it does not intrude on the users experience when not needed.
        </p>
        <p>  A second aspect we had noticed that is popular is that of animated images that act as links to additional pages. These images normally contain some white space between them to ensure the user can identify between the images and has a hover effect that animates the image (normally zooms out or spans the image). 
        </p>
        <p>  We have also noticed that the landing page that most users will see tends to be the most animated of the pages. This would include animated images, videos and interesting transitions. This is obviously to intrigue people into exploring the website thus gain more traffic (resulting in a more successful website). 
   </p>
        <p> As you can see, I have attempted to implement the navigation bar technique that most of these websites have implemented (horizontal, on top of page ect). However, I was unsuccessful at making the navigation bar include animations that either hide it when the user scrolls down as I have little experience with CSS.
          </p>
        <p>I did attempt to implement some kind of animated image effect on the links below (links to influential websites)however, I was unable to find a method that centres and image when in mobile mode.</p>
