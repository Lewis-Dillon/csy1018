        <h2><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/"> Code Academy</a></h2>
    <p>Code academy is a useful site for people who are reletivly new to HTML and CSS coding. It works via selecting the desired course you wish to learn and the site will give you a step by step tutorial on how to learn coding. This involves Having detailed desciptions of what they are trying to teach you, examples of what is being taught and even allows the user to work along side the tutorial to ensure the point is hammered home. </p>
        <h2><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/"> W3schools </a></h2>
    <p> W3schools provides a user basic and advanced tutorials on how to code with either CSS or HTML. This site works solely on a reading basis of which can be quite difficult to follow however, example code is provided to allow a user to activly look at what is being taught and even alter said code for further learning. A downside to this site however, is that some examples tends to lack CSS (of which is done in html). </p> 
        <h2><a href="https://www.codewars.com/">Codewars</a></h2>
    <p>Codewars is an odd one as it does provide tutorials on how to program in html and css, but is very linear. It requires a user to sign up to access most features and is comunity focused (users signed up can create their own tutorials). Most tutorials availible are unable to be edited unless forked thus can be quite a hassle to learn in a practical sense. </p>
        <h2><a href="http://html5doctor.com/">HTML5 Doctor</a></h2>
    <p>HTML5 Doctor is a site of which takes advantage of forums to give users information on how to code in html. The downside to this iste is that it does not include information regarding CSS, and is not very interactable (as it is a forum, most code is just static text that need to be put in an editor in order to do things). </p> 
        <h2><a href="https://digital.com/tools/html-cheatsheet/#kbd"> HTML Cheat Sheet</a></h2>
    <p> Although this page does not intend to teach users on the coding itself, it provides definitions on what a tag represents. This can be quite useful for people who are attempting to learn what certain tags represent in HTML and how said tages are used in the coding.</p>
        <h2><a href="https://www.onblastblog.com/css3-cheat-sheet/"> CSS Cheat Sheet</a></h2>
    <p>Similar to the HTML Cheat Sheet, Does not intend to directly teach you how to code in CSS just gives definitions of tags that are used. This can be quite restictive as no clear examples are given to how to apply them to CSS. Thus is resource would be mainly useful for experienced users. </p>
        <h2><a href="https://codepen.io/">Codepen</a></h2>
        <p> Codepen may not exactly be a website dedicated to teaching users how to code, but it does allow users a more hands on experience through how community drivin this site is. It allows a user to fork code from another user and thus play around with said code. This is a great tool for those who learn practically but does not provide official tutorials (tutorials may be provided by the community.</p>
